You can ask me about it on the phone if you want.</p><p>Today Denise and I were supposed to go on a surprise date. I usually have surprise dates in which I don't tell Denise where or what we are going to do. Usually those are debates or public lectures about topics we care about and often they are free and close by on campus. For example, when we just started dating I took her to a debate between two pop-philosophers.</p><p>Denise got home early afternoon and we spent some time here. When we were supposed to leave she decided to stay and work on her last paper for her class. By the way, this is the last week of classes and the school year is almost over! This one really flew by!</p><p>So, Denise decided to stay home but I went to check the events. There were two of those. The first was a performance of 'Shaharzada' by Rimsky-Korsakov and the other was a debate about whether or not the Guvernor-General should have proroged parliment (I will explain soon).</p><p>Both those events were at Hart House, which is a beutifull old building that serves as a student space with a gym, restaurant, library, theater and many different rooms.Â  Unfortunaterly, the two events overlapped a little so I jumpled between the two.</p><p>The Shaharzada performance I had high hopes for. I once went to see it with dad in Tel-Aviv and it was really good. This one was perfomred by a student band with some guests but apparently they only did the first part and then they did other pieces. Also, it was very hot, so I left after a little while for the other event. Here are two pictures of the hall where the concert took place:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-79"><img loading="lazy" title="Hart House great hall 1" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/p1040762.jpg" alt="Hart House great hall 1" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040762-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><figure class="size-full wp-image-80"><img loading="lazy" title="Hart House great hall 2" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/p1040759.jpg" alt="Hart House great hall 2" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040759-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>OK, so that was the concert. The other event takes a little explanation and I hope I will explain it well. First, it was a debate hosted by the debate club. The tradition of debates is not very strong in Israel but it is very common it England and North America (and maybe other places). Usually debates have a political nature but not always. The debate this time was about something which happened in November last year in Canadian politics. The system here is kind of similar to Israel but a little different. To make it easier, they have a position here called the "Governor-General" (GG), which is not an elected position and is officially the representative of the Queen of England in Canada. It is a little bit like the Israeli president in that it is usually taken as a ceremonial position but it has some real powers that are needed in times of political uncertainty.</p><p>The comparison with Israel works very well because we had a similar situation with the last election. Livni officially won more votes then Bibi and Peres, as the president needs to decide who getsthe first chance at forming a government. This is not easy, you don't just choose Livni because she won one more seat. The GG in Canada has similar responsibility (among others) and there is a political process called "prorogation" in which the parliament (the KNESET) is suspended for a few weeks and when they come back they start with a new agenda, meaning, all the different laws they were working on start from fresh. Never mind why they do it, take it as a fact, and the GG is the one who decides to do it when asked by the Prime minister. When the Prime Minister asks the GG to do it is usually ok since the Prime Minister has a majority support in the parliament</p><p>A few weeks after the last Canadian elections the biggest party (the Conseratives) didn't have a majority and the other three parties wanted to try a coalition. In Israel every government is a coalition but in Canada it is not common. The Prime Minister, who was just elected and haven't actually faced a vote of confidence, went to the GG and asked her to proroge (suspend) parliament. This was an awekward situation since usually the GG acts based on what the Prime Minister asks because he has the confidence of the parliament, but this time it wasn't clear - we just had an election and there was not a vote of confidence yet (or a budget vote, which is usually taken as a confidence vote) and it was clear that if we had a vote he would lose. He was, in fact, trying to avoid the vote of confidence because he knew he will lose.</p><p>So this was a big deal here. The GG ended up doing it and we didn't have parliament for about 7 weeks. Anyways, the reason I'm telling you all of this (other than that I find it interesting) is that the debate today was about whether or not she did right. They had some very interesting people in the crowed including the most famous professor in Canada for constitutional law and a previous Governor-General. It was very interesting and I wish I went to more debates. Here is a picture from the part where the past GG spoke:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-81"><img loading="lazy" title="Hart House debate" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/p1040770.jpg" alt="Hart House debate" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1433/responsive/p1040770-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>We have some climbing movies but we need to edit them so I hope I will have time to do that soon.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Free%20events https%3A%2F%2Fyfarkash.github.io%2Fsunrisesunset%2Ffree-events.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/birthday-party-and-shakshuka.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Birthday Party and Shakshuka!</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/a-christian-weekend-somewhat.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> A christian weekend (somewhat)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
