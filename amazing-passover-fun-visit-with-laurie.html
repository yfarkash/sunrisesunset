(They got chocolate gold coins as well!)</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-130"><img loading="lazy" title="Yoav Helping the Musicians With Hebrew" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p1040813.jpg" alt="Yoav Helping the Musicians With Hebrew" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040813-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><figure class="size-full wp-image-133"><img loading="lazy" title="Everyone at the Table for the Seder" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p10408052.jpg" alt="Everyone at the Table for the Seder" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408052-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p><strong>Seder at Danny and Debbie's:</strong></p><p>My friend Laurie arrived on Wednesday night so I did not go to the Seder at Harry and Judy's with Yoav because I had to pick her up at the airport.  Laurie and I both attended Danny and Debbie's Seder the next night.  We both had a wonderful time.  (Laurie may even write a guest blog about her experience.)  We arrived and were greeted very warmly.  It took just a few minutes for Laurie to connect with Debbie's sister Tricia, as they are both single mothers with young children.  I met Judy for the first time, but knew everyone else from previous events with the Kornhausers.  When the Seder started with 'There's No Seder Like Our Seder' (to the tune of 'There's No Business Like Show Business') I knew we were in for a fun time!  Yoav has given you lots of pictures and videos below so you get a feel for the atmosphere.  It was fun and lively, yet there was a social consciousness that linked the themes of Passover with some current issues where people are greatly suffering. (Darfur for example.)  I liked how Danny also gave opportunities for people to take action and do good.  He gave out information on a rally, provided a website, and told us about a community 'Mitzvah Day' coming up in a few weeks.  Laurie described the Seder as a spiritual renewal - she said it was like milk and honey for the soul!  It really was like that.  I feel so blessed to know Danny and Debbie and their family and always feel so inspired and joyful after spending time with them.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-122"><img loading="lazy" title="Joshua, Denise and Matzah!" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p1040850.jpg" alt="Joshua, Denise and Matzah!" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040850-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p><strong>Visit with Laurie:</strong></p><p>I met Laurie when I worked at General Electric in San Rafael, California (2001 - 2003).  San Rafael is about 25 minutes North of San Francisco, over the Golden Gate bridge and into Marin County.  We have been dear friends ever since and managed to keep up our friendship even being so far apart.  I had visited Laurie, but this was the first time she came to Toronto.   She arrived Wednesday evening, April 8th.  We got to grab a bite to eat and have a drink at pub together to catch up a bit.  We headed home and Yoav arrived just after us (back from the Seder at Judy and Harry's)  The next day was Thursday - I had to work at the hospital until around 4 pm so she went at lunch time with Yoav and his friend from the lab for a sushi lunch.  Then I met her, Yoav and my friend Harry at the coffee shop in the lobby of the hospital where I work.  Harry took Laurie to see the AGO (Art Gallery of Ontario).  It just reopened after long renovations so I have not yet seen it.  They really enjoyed it!  We reconvened at home to go to the Seder at Debbie and Danny's.  Laurie was VERY excited to attend a Seder meal.  Her mother, a religious Catholic, held Seders for her family growing up.  Needless to say they were nothing like the real deal!  We didn't get back from the Seder until after 1 am - luckily I had a holiday for Good Friday so there was no work Friday.</p><p>Laurie, Yoav and I started the beautiful sunny day by eating cheeses ('Cheese for Jesus' since it was Good Friday!) and having a breakfast of Shakshukah! (My favourite!)  The weather was warm so we headed for a walk through Kensington Market and had a coffee outdoors.  We ran into Ronen, a friend and member of a Jewish band we love, called the Dull-Eyed Llamas.  Ronen played DAYENU for us on the accordion!  Below are some pictures from the market and our lovely coffee outdoors.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-120"><img loading="lazy" title="Denise, Ronen and Laurie in Kensington Market, Toronto" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p1040881.jpg" alt="Denise, Ronen and Laurie in Kensington Market, Toronto" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040881-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>And this is Ronen in action:</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPbFTrAdRz4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6&amp;border=1]</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-118"><img loading="lazy" title="Yoav Drinking and Laurie Writing Postcards" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p1040885.jpg" alt="Yoav Drinking and Laurie Writing Postcards" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p1040885-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><figure class="size-full wp-image-121"><img loading="lazy" title="Denise Happy for Spring" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/p10408921.jpg" alt="Denise Happy for Spring" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1436/responsive/p10408921-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>Next we headed to the climbing gym where Yoav and I showed Laurie a huge part of our life here - climbing at the Rock Oasis!  She was scared of the height at first, but then got her groove and made it to the top several times!  After climbing, we visited good friends Harry and Allison who live near the gym.  Laurie and I got a sneak peek at Allison's newly found wedding dress.  She and Harry are getting married on July 25th in Lions Head at Harry's cottage.  Yuval will be at the camp nearby and he will be in town then, so he will be attending their wedding!</p><p>Laurie (and Yoav and I) were getting hungry so we headed off to Real Thailand, a Thai Restaurant on Bloor Street near where we live.  We were joined by a friend Maxim, who works with me at Mount Sinai hospital.  It was a delicious treat which we don't eat often since it is so high in fat.  (Just like burekas!)  We then returned to our place to have some wine, cheese and chocolate while playing the board game, "Cranium".  Laurie and I played against Maxim and Yoav.  In the beginning, Yoav and Maxim took the lead and Laurie and I couldn't get a point.  Then all of a sudden we took off and had a streak of correct answers!  We were victorious!   The game was a 'Canadian Edition' so it was somewhat customized to a Canadian crowd, making it harder for both Yoav and Laurie.</p><p>Of course I was getting so heavy-eyed I could not even think about going out longer!  It was 12:30 pm when these three headed out to College Street for a mini pub crawl!  They talked politics and relationships - a logical combination!  Sounds like a good time was had by all, although Yoav was quite distressed the next day by some of the political views expressed!  I think too capitalist for his taste!  When Laurie got back, she had a long (drunken) conversation with her new boyfriend over the phone.  Yoav was out like a light.  The next morning came fast for those two!</p><p>Saturday morning, we picked up some cheeses for Laurie to bring home to her boyfriend Rob, and then we were off to Waterloo for brunch with my parents.  Laurie really wanted to meet them and they wanted to meet her too - they had even stayed at her beautiful townhouse in Sausalito when I was in the Bay Area but didn't meet Laurie (since I was renting the place and she was out of town).  We went to a diner called 'Angel's' and I think Laurie benefited from the coffee refills!  Everyone had a nice brunch.  Then we returned to my parents' apartment and my mom showed Laurie lots of pictures.  (Yoav and I had a quick cat nap on the couch recliner while this was going on!)  Sadly by now, it was time to drop Laurie off at the airport.  A quick visit but a good visit!</p><p>Laurie is from Seattle so I'll get to visit with her in August before the family trip - and I'll get to meet her parents.  AND you'll likely get to meet her too, even if only for a quick hello.</p><p>It has been such a nice Passover and visit.  Now we must work, work, work!  I have a final paper due for my Masters course and Yoav is trying to get back into the mode of writing his thesis.  We were pretty productive yesterday.  Today is also a holiday so we're going to keep up the good work and hopefully make more good progress.</p><p>Chag Sameach!  Love,</p><p>Denise</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Amazing%20Passover%2C%20Fun%20Visit%20With%20Laurie https%3A%2F%2Fyfarkash.github.io%2Fsunrisesunset%2Famazing-passover-fun-visit-with-laurie.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/what-a-passover.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> What a passover!</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/tov-mayod.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Tov Mayod!</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
