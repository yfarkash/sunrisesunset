On Christmas evening (December 24th) We went to Denise's parents in Waterloo. The drive was easy and we got there in time for dinner. Her aunt Shirley joined us. We had dinner and had some laughs about the kids in the family (Denise's cousins and their kids). After dinner we opened the presents. There were SO many presents, it was a really luxurious Christmas! This took some time, after which Shirley left and we just went to sleep.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-271"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p1050863.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Our cute Santa delivering presents" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p1050863.jpg" alt="Our cute Santa delivering presents" width="490" height="367" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p1050863-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><figure class="size-full wp-image-276"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p10508661.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Denise delivering presents to her dad and mom" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p10508661.jpg" alt="Denise delivering presents to her dad and mom" width="490" height="367" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508661-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><p>On the 25th (Christmas day) I drove over to Mike's place. I spent the day there doing nothing pretty much, just chatting, helping with dinner etc. As every year, Mike's grandparents came over in the afternoon to do the presents and his cousin and uncle and aunt joined later on for dinner. His mom (Helen) is a great cook, it was delicious. We talked some politics (of course) and had some drinks and after cleaning played some games.</p><p>The 26th I drove back to Waterloo. We went over to Denise's aunt Mary for the afternoon where we met with her cousins and their kids, had food and played some games. Of course, there was some presents opening! Afterward we went to Irene and Bob, those are family friends of Denises parents and herself. We usually go there during the holidays. We exchanged presents, as usual, followed by food and a poker game. Denise and I didn't get far in the poker, which is ok since we won the last three games we played with them in the past. From there we head home again where Denise's mom and I watched some hockey before falling asleep.</p><p>The 27th (Sunday) Audrey and Hector (Denise's parents) went to church early on and we slept in. At around 12:00 we went to visit Sunny and Pam. This is one of the moms of Denise's friends Gilian (who is in Buenos Aires right now) and Garth (who is in Thailand right now). It is a complicated story, but basically, back some 30+ years ago, Shirley and Sunny were a couple living together. They had Gillian and Garth and later on in life they split up. Sunny now lives with Pam and Shirley now lives with Fritz. So we went visiting both, Sunny first and Shirley second. In between we stopped at Denise's aunt Mary again to give her their present because we forgot it the day before. It was nice since we actually had some time to chat which we couldn't when it was all busy the day before.</p><p>After all this visiting and eating we went back to Denise's parents place where I showed her mom a few things about her computer and we drove back home. I wanted to get home the same day even though it was late. The way home was fine but Denise gets nervous when it is night and there is some snow of the roads. So she was reading one of the books she got for me to distract her and at some point she started reading it out loud for me which made the drive go by really fast. It is an interesting book called "the 4 hour workweek" which I really want Danny to read.</p><p>When we got home we un-packed all the presents. Here is the mountain of presents:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-278"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p10508771.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="We got a lot of presents this year!" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/p10508771.jpg" alt="We got a lot of presents this year!" width="490" height="367" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1447/responsive/p10508771-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><p>OK, that's it for now.</p><p>Hugs,</p><p>Yoav</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Christmas https%3A%2F%2Fyfarkash.github.io%2Fsunrisesunset%2Fchristmas.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/winter-affairs.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Winter affairs</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/january-3rd-2020-abba-is-a-canadian-citizen.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> January 3rd, 2020: Abba is a Canadian Citizen!</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
