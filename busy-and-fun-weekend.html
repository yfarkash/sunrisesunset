Saturday we woke up and had our usual lazy start but then Denise had to go and clean up some last things out of her apartment. Unfortunately, she had to clean the outside and it was raining . I was at the lab the whole afternoon. We then had dinner plans with friends of Denise who live north of the city, about 1 hour north in a suburb of Toronto called Richmond Hill. Maxin works with Denise in the hospital and him and his wife invited us over for dinner. She plays the guitar and we had some nice fish soup. Since we were that far of the city we decided to spend the night over. We also knew of a climbing gym which is close to them so we planned on trying it out on Sunday morning. Maxin and Elizabeth have two kids so all of us went. Unfortunately, I was up until about 4 in the morning (we changed the clocks one hour forward between Saturday and Sunday) playing music with Elizabth so I was really tired. But it was great waking up again in a house with kids, I miss it. The young girl (Rene) was running around and singing, it was great. We finally made it to the new climbing gym and spent some time with the kids but Denise and I were both too tired so after about 20 minutes on our own we decided to head out. We were supposed to have dinner with my friend Kassidy, who also lives north of the city (but not so far)Â  but there was no way we were driving up again. We ended having dinner in an Italian restaurant which ended up being a good call, the food was great. We finally made it home at aroud 17:30 and almost immediately fell asleep. Unfortunately, Denise had some stomach ache and woke up around 22:00, which means I woke up too. She was fine after an hour or so and she is back asleep now but I find it very hard to go back to bed after 4 hours of sleep so I've been up since (it is 01:00 now).</p><p>Friday night we had a nice Hebrew lesson. Denise started working on the books Michal gave her and read a whole pge on her own. It is really wiered to try and teach and adult. Usually the kids learn to speek first and they know the words,they just need to figure out how to write and read them. With adults it is the other way of course, it is easy to learn how to read and write (Denise reads with very few mistakes now) but she doesn't usually know what the words mean. Anyways, it is one oof our fun activitis. Here is a picture of the Hebrew student in action:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-52"><img loading="lazy" title="Hebrew lesson" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/p10405951.jpg" alt="Hebrew lesson" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1430/responsive/p10405951-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Busy%20and%20fun%20weekend https%3A%2F%2Fyfarkash.github.io%2Fsunrisesunset%2Fbusy-and-fun-weekend.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/sushi-with-gillian-and-ken.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Sushi with Gillian and Ken</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/denises-work-sushi-party.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Denise&#x27;s work sushi party</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
