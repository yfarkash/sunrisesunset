I want to tell you about last weekend. It was Science Rendezvous weekend in Toronto. It is a day in which different scientific institutions, including universities and hospitals, open their doors to the public to talk about science. There were also meetings in coffee shops and pubs where scientists had open conversations about it. I volunteered with the hospital to put a presentation of what we do in the lab. Dave and JP (our technician) helped out and we set up two microscopes to let people look at cells. It was a fun experience to go through the planning and the whole process leading to it, there is so much happening behind the scenes!</p><p>Here is a picture:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-168"><img loading="lazy" title="Dave (Left), ne and JP (right)" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/p1050030.jpg" alt="Dave (Left), ne and JP (right)" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050030-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>Other than that, we are mostly busy with looking for a place to move into. We want a yard or a patio where we can grow plants and have a BBQ, so we are pretty selective. Also, we were a little bit concerned with signing up for a full year because Denise is considering buying a house and we didn't want to have to wait because it is a good time for that. I think we will move into a place soon. I hope so, I want to have the BBQ!</p><p>We had some windy cold days here again. However, all the trees are in bloom which is beautiful!Â  Last week on the way to work we walked by this little plaza at the entrance to a building. The wind was blowing really hard and blew the pink flowers off the tree, it was gorgeous!</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-171"><img loading="lazy" title="Nice blooms" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/p10500471.jpg" alt="Nice blooms" width="500" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p10500471-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><figure class="size-full wp-image-170"><img loading="lazy" title="Flowers in the wind" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/p1050051.jpg" alt="Flowers in the wind" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050051-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>Also recently Denise started a class in her hospital called Nia, it is an excercise class which is a little bit of dance, yoga (?) and martial arts. She will write more about it. It is on Wednesdays from 17:00-18:00 and she seems to like it. The funny thing is that about a year ago we went for dinner with Tricia (Debbie's sister) and her boyfriend at the time and some of his friends came along, where we met this lady, Marla, who we both liked and had a good time with. I remember she told me she was a Nia instructor and invited us to try. We never saw her again, but she is the one doing the classes in the hospital so we might go out wiht her soon. Small world! Last week her hospital had a the nursing week and she had a booth to promote the healthy workplace program. Here she is:</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-167"><img loading="lazy" title="Denise healthy workplace" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/p1050044.jpg" alt="Denise healthy workplace" width="500" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-xs.jpg 640w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-sm.jpg 768w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-md.jpg 1024w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-lg.jpg 1366w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-xl.jpg 1600w, https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/media/posts/1440/responsive/p1050044-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>Last night I went to see a play in the theater, Doubt. There was a movie based on it recently. The plot is set in a church school. The principal (a nun) suspects the priest to sexully abuse one of the kids. It is never said but is suggested based on the conversations. She has no proof of it but she is still convinced. The play revolves around the (un)certainty and walks the line between personal conviction, when we believe someone, when we doubt, the demange that can done etc. It was excellent and I recommnad watching the movie.</p><p>Other then that, tomorrow we are finally going climbing outdoors for the first time this year, so I should go to bed and get some sleep!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Science%20Rendezvous https%3A%2F%2Fyfarkash.github.io%2Fsunrisesunset%2Fscience-rendezvous.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/wedding-weekend.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Wedding weekend</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/moving-denises-birthday.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Moving, Denise&#x27;s birthday</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://yfarkash.github.io/sunrisesunset/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
